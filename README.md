# NetSnippets
Snippets Collection for .Net | Make your Contribution!

## What is a Snippet?
It is a portion of code that usually contains one or more Subroutines with the purpose of performing a specific task,
Whose code is reusable by other people and easy to integrate by just copying and pasting the Snippet content.

### Notes
- Why is the index disordered alphabetically?
What may appear to be alphabet disorder is more of a chronological order.

- Why are there repeated snippets?
Not all nippets are mine, but the vast majority yes, hence for this question I answered about myself:
in principle there are none repeated, what happens is that over time I have been publishing updates / improvements of old codes. Hence my preference for chronological order.
